# Registering slash commands 
`bin/afhbot` needs to be given 'register' as argument to register slash commands. This needs to be done only once unless the commands are updated.

After this just run `bin/afhbot` under Docker without arguments and it will use the configuration file for all needed options.

(Needs improvement)
